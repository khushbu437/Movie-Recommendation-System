Users can search for movies, and the system provides personalized recommendations based on their preferences. The recommendation engine utilizes a content-based approach, considering factors such as genre, director, and keywords to suggest relevant movies. The simple GUI ensures a seamless user experience, with the HTML and CSS creating an intuitive interface. Feel free to explore, search for your favorite movies, and discover new ones tailored to your tastes.
